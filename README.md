# Overview
By analyzing the school districts performance and budget, city officials can take an educated path on future funding and programs that will help boost effeciency and increase grades and learning opportunities. A well presented summary of the district's stats and performance will allow the stakeholders more time to discuss and implement plans instead of being mired in a single static dataset. 

# Method

-Create summary tables at the district level and the school level. Using these key metrics:
Schools
Students
Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
% Overall Passing

-Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing and bottom 5 schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


-Math Scores by Grade

Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


-Reading Scores by Grade

Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


-Scores by School Spending 
-Scores by School Size
-Scores by School Type

Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:





## -School Analysis-

Charter schools achieve higher testing scores and higher passing percentages than the District schools. Math and Reading scores stay consistent by school as you move amongst the grades. Showing that there is no jump or dip in performance. You could conclude that means the faculty at each school is consistent in it's teaching ablilities. School size has an effect on test scores. As the schools get larger in size, their test scores start to trend down. This could speak to the effectiveness of the teachers in a larger class size.
